# 🌌 CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNNs
![CIFAR-10 Image Classification](image.png) 


## 🌐 Overview
The __CIFAR-10__ dataset stands as a beacon in machine learning and image classification. Consisting of __60,000 vivid color images__ with dimensions of __32x32 pixels__, it encapsulates the vibrant spectrum of everyday objects and creatures, subdivided into __10 distinct classes__: 

- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

Each category is uniformly distributed, holding 6,000 images each. Of the entire dataset, 50,000 images are earmarked for training, leaving the remaining 10,000 for testing. Through this project, our mission is to craft and educate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that showcases adept classification proficiency on this diverse dataset.
